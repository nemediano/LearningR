# LearningR
A sandbox of examples created while learning the R language

I follow three resources so far:
1 An introduction to R. From the oficial site: https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html
2 Hands on programming R. From github: https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/
3 R for data science. From here: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/

The first one is in the introduction folder
The second in the book folder
The last one (yet to start) in the DSBook folder.
